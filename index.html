                <h1>Exploring Major Religions Beliefs</h1>
                <p>Today's blog gives a brief overview of four major religions: Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, and
                    Islam.
                    We explore their core beliefs and philosophies, from Christianity’s focus on faith in Jesus Christ,
                    to
                    Hinduism’s concepts of karma and moksha, Sikhism’s emphasis on equality and service, and Islam’s
                    devotion to Allah through the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.</p>

            <p>Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge, which is power; religion gives
                man wisdom, which is control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with values. The
                two are not rivals.</p>
